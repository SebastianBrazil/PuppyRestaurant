Puppy Restaurant

Puppy restaurant is a website that was developed from a prototype. The desktop mode is created to resemble the prototype as closely as possible, while the tablet and mobile modes are created to prevent the website from breaking when using smaller resolutions.  

11/6/23: Created the file structure and initialized the repo. 11/7/23: Started work on the first three pages. 11/8/23: Started work on the last two pages and completed all of the pages. 11/9/23: Added mobile and tablet responsiveness.

+ Peer Review by Ashur Nanno; 5:45pm 11.09.2023: 

+ Navbar is not designed for mobile/tablet; not responsive(example: hamburger menue)
+ Homepage look good and very close to the mockup design.
+ all other pages: in full desktop view looks very nice and almost identical to the mockup desing; but need more work in mobile/tablet mode to make all columns/containers/sectors have the same width.
+ But Overall An amazing site with very few flaws with responsiveness. In the desktop size, the site is close to the design of the mockup!  great work keep it up!
