Puppy Restaurant

Description

11/6/23: Created the file structure and initialized the repo. 

+ Peer Review by Ashur Nanno; 5:45pm 11.09.2023: 

+ Navbar is not designed for mobile/tablet; not responsive(example: hamburger menue)
+ Homepage look good and very close to the mockup design.
+ all other pages: in full desktop view looks very nice and almost identical to the mockup desing; but need more work in mobile/tablet mode to make all columns/containers/sectors have the same width.
+ But Overall An amazing site with very few flaws with responsiveness. In the desktop size, the site is close to the design of the mockup!  great work keep it up!
